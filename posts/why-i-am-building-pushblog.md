## I just wanted to write

A few weeks ago I wanted to get back to publishing some technical content. Some time ago, I used to publish on one of the most popular developer blogging platforms.  

I really liked the platform, and especially the massive audience and community but I had some issues with the main page - feed. I felt it was too noisy, and really hard to follow what was happening there. The other thing was a chase for likes and other engagements - I prefer to focus on the content, and to select topics of my choice rather than the most hot topics at the moment. These days it feels even harder to spot personal content, AI-generated posts are more common. I really appreciate the fact, that we can use AI for significant number of tasks, and even I as a non-native English speaker love to use it for grammar mistakes checking. But I want my reading time to focus on human thoughts, not an algorithm output.

The other option I considered was to pay for some product - out of the box or self-hosted. My key condition was the ease of configuration and management. I didn’t want to spend the whole weekend on the cycle - error - google - fix and somehow get the whole thing working. Unfortunately, I didn’t find anything I liked so I decided to create my own product. The blogging engine tailored for my requirements - minimalism over overwhelming number of features. 

I decided that I could push markdown files to github repository, and my engine would build a static-minimal html post based on this. 

After a while I realised that with some additional engineering effort I could build not an engine but the ready-to go platform for other engineers / writers like me. This should be focused on minimalism, dev experience with a strong focus on SEO and analytics.

 ## The philosophy behind PushBlog

- **Human first, AI-free zone.** As I mentioned before, these days, and the internet is being taken over by AI and bots. I deeply feel that I’m not alone saying that I don’t want to waste my time on reading things made by AI. Hey, I can do that on my own, writing prompt in ChatGPT, can’t I!?
- **Simplicity** - all you need to do is, a one click onboarding of your github repository, add an md file, and just push it. As simple as that!
- **You own your data - no vendor locking**, since you keep your posts in your own repository, the potential migration would be a piece of cake.
- **Soft-skills topic / personal thoughts**, and everything related to engineering / product / team building are more than welcome.
- **And the last but not least - a tech community!** I hope that I’m able to build a micro-community around this platform. That is my ultimate goal. As I mentioned before, at the end of the day, we all are social creatures, it’s super cool to have some mates open for discussion and ready to give the feedback.

## What’s the goal?

The ultimate goal is to build a micro (but heavy engaged) community. Once this is done, I can say that I did a really good job. The side effect will be creating a really nice and valuable product. In that order. 

I want also to embark this journey because it’s really challenging. I need to face many issues like making a right decision from product perspective, strategic thinking, marketing. Even things like DNS records setup are quite new to me, so it will be quite tough but really rewarding if I can accomplish it. 

I need to say that this product can be good for me to position myself not only as a good backend-engineer with some solid knowledge of cloud infrastructure but also a person with product thinking which is the future of programming in my view. 

## What’s the plan?

- Build in public - I want to share how the PushBlog is built. Expects updates of the progress to be published here. Some part of the solution (or even all? I haven’t decided yet) will be open-sourced. If you have any side project, SaaS or micro SaaS and want to share the progress or elaborate about a particular part of it - feel free to use PushBlog.
- I will write about other topics too
- Build like a hacker, polish like a pro. This is how I see the process of building the PushBlog. I want to invite early adopters as soon as possible, and improve the product iteratively. Iteration is the King, and this approach allows you to see some progress, and react on the changing environment. At the end of the day, it’s a pretty much shame if you spent months on building the very first version of your product and nobody is interested in using it. That’s why I’m trying to publish something as soon as possible. Does it mean that PushBlog may be a bit buggy? Yes, of course. Will be fully-packed with features? Not at the beginning. I want to treat all of those things as constraints and let users know what the current capabilities are, and how to work around them if needed. The product will be polished iteratively too, so it will be getting better and better.
- Hear the community - I really appreciate every feedback / feature request. I strongly believe this is the way to build outstanding products.
- In the long term provide so valuable product, that people will pay for it. Not because they have to but because they see the value it brings.
- The free plan will be enough for 90% of authors. Premium features will be something extra. I’m not revealing my ideas for now because they could be treated like a commitment, and I want to avoid it for now. After some time, I’ll build and publish the roadmap.

This is how I see the nearest future of the PushBlog. The product is being built as a side project, so the pace is not extra ordinary, but constant.
